### Technical Details - TESTED ✅
```python
# API endpoints (using free test key "123")
base_url = "https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/123"

# Get all games for a season
season_games = f"{base_url}/eventsseason.php?id=4391&s=2019"

# Get league information
league_info = f"{base_url}/search_all_leagues.php?s=American%20Football"

# NFL League ID: 4391
```

### Sample Data Structure
```json
{
  "idEvent": "600748",
  "strEvent": "Atlanta Falcons vs Denver Broncos",
  "strSeason": "2019",
  "dateEvent": "2019-08-01",
  "strHomeTeam": "Atlanta Falcons",

## Implementation Plan

### Option A: TheSportsDB Migration (RECOMMENDED - 2-4 hours total)

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (30 minutes)
```python
import requests

# Test TheSportsDB API access
base_url = "https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/123"
test_url = f"{base_url}/eventsseason.php?id=4391&s=2019"

response = requests.get(test_url)
data = response.json()
print(f"Retrieved {len(data['events'])} games for 2019 season")
```

#### Phase 2: Code Migration (2-3 hours)
1. Update `src/Utils/tools.py` to use TheSportsDB endpoints
2. Replace sportsdata.io URLs in `config.toml` with TheSportsDB equivalents
3. Update data parsing to handle TheSportsDB JSON structure
4. Remove API key requirements (use free test key "123")

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (1 hour)
1. Verify data completeness for all required years (2019-2024)
2. Test existing ML pipeline with new data source
3. Update documentation

### Option B: nfl_data_py Migration (4-6 hours total)

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1-2 hours)
```bash
pip install nfl_data_py
```

Create a test script to verify data availability:
```python
import nfl_data_py as nfl

# Test data availability for your required years
years = [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024]
pbp_data = nfl.import_pbp_data(years=years)
print(f"Retrieved {len(pbp_data)} play-by-play records")

weekly_data = nfl.import_weekly_data(years=years)
print(f"Retrieved {len(weekly_data)} weekly records")
```

#### Phase 2: Code Migration (4-6 hours)
1. Replace sportsdata.io API calls with nfl_data_py functions
2. Update data processing to handle new data structure
3. Modify database schema if needed for improved data structure
4. Update configuration to remove API key requirements

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (2-3 hours)
1. Verify data completeness for all required years
2. Compare data quality with previous sportsdata.io data
3. Test ML model performance with new data source
4. Update documentation

## Alternative Backup Plan

If nfl_data_py doesn't meet all requirements, consider:
1. **Hybrid approach**: Use nfl_data_py for historical data + ESPN APIs for real-time updates
2. **Paid upgrade**: Upgrade sportsdata.io subscription for historical access
3. **Data purchase**: One-time historical data purchase from a provider

The nfl_data_py solution should eliminate your subscription limitations while providing better data quality for machine learning applications.
