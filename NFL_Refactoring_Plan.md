## Conclusion

The NFL refactoring represents a significant but achievable undertaking. The structured 4-phase approach minimizes risk while ensuring each component is thoroughly tested before integration. Expected outcomes include improved prediction accuracy (60-80% vs NBA's 69%) due to NFL's inherently more predictable nature.

The key success factor will be robust data collection in Phase 1, as NFL lacks the comprehensive official APIs available for NBA. However, the potential for higher accuracy and profitability makes this refactoring a worthwhile investment.
